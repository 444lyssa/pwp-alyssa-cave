<h2>Persona</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><h3>Name: Mary Poppins</h3></li>
        <li><h3>Description:</h3>
            <p>Technology: Mary Poppins is proficient at using both Apple and Android technology. She mostly uses her iPhone to search the web unless she's at work on her desktop which uses the latest version of Microsoft. </p>
            <p>Behaviors and attitudes: Mary is looking to throw birthday party for her soon-to-be 18-year-old daughter. She has been on the internet looking for cool things that can entertain her guests at a reasonable price. She is also looking for a way to capture the moment without having to be stuck on her phone, camera or anything else that might pull her away from the fun. Mary wants to make sure that she can have fun at the birthday too, so she is definitely looking for something that takes care of itself and doesn't need to be set up or put away.</p>
            <p>Goal: Book simple, reasonably priced, and low maintenance entertainment for her daughter's 18th birthday.</p></li>
    </ul>
